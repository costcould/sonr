## Threshold ECDSA

Important: The authors of GG20 have stated that the protocol is obsolete and should not be used. See [https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/540.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/540.pdf).

This package is an implementation of t-of-n threshold signature of
[One Round Threshold ECDSA with Identifiable Abort](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/540.pdf).

It supports tECDSA with two different key generation approaches:

1. key generation with a trusted dealer and
2. distributed key generation.
